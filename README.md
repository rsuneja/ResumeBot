## Build Your Bot - Steps :

1. First, sign up for a free account at [smooch.io](https://app.smooch.io/signup)

1. With a new Smooch app created, go to the settings tab and take note of your App Token. Also, generate a new Secret Key, and take note of the key ID and secret.

1. Deploy your app to Heroku using the button below. It's a service for hosting apps so go sign up if you don't already have an account â€“ it's free. You'll need to specify your app token, key ID, and secret in the app's `SMOOCH_APP_TOKEN`, `SMOOCH_KEY_ID`, and `SMOOCH_SECRET` config settings.

1. Your app should now be running on Heroku but you're not quite done yet. Take note of the URL where your heroku app is running, for example `https://yourbot.herokuapp.com`. You'll need to specify this in your heroku app `SERVICE_URL` config variable. You can do this in the Heroku control panel under *Settings* > *Config Variables*. Make sure to go under Deploy and connect to your GitHub repo. Then, enable Automatic Deploys from the master branch (this means anytime you make an edit to your bot's script, it'll automatically update and talk as intended in seconds.) 

1. You should be all set. Open your Heroku app and start chatting with your new bot!

The file script.json comes in. It's the document you need to edit to make your bot talk.

Keywords are not case sensitive for users.

The only two keywords you don't want to change are CONNECT ME and DISCONNECT. CONNECT ME turns the automated chat off, so the bot will stop responding to keywords. DISCONNECT will turn the bot back on.
